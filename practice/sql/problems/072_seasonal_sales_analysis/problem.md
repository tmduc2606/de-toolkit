# SQL072 — Seasonal Sales Analysis

> Source: LeetCode 3564 (hand-solved, not part of the SQL 50 answersheet).

## Problem statement

Table: `sales`

| Column Name | Type |
|---|---|
| sale_id | int |
| product_id | int |
| sale_date | date |
| quantity | int |
| price | decimal |

`sale_id` is the unique identifier for this table. Each row contains
information about a product sale including the product_id, date of sale,
quantity sold, and price per unit.

Table: `products`

| Column Name | Type |
|---|---|
| product_id | int |
| product_name | varchar |
| category | varchar |

`product_id` is the unique identifier for this table. Each row contains
information about a product including its name and category.

Find the most popular product category for each season. The seasons are
defined as:

- **Winter**: December, January, February
- **Spring**: March, April, May
- **Summer**: June, July, August
- **Fall**: September, October, November

The **popularity** of a category is determined by the **total quantity
sold** in that season. Ties are broken by the highest **total revenue**
(`quantity × price`), then by the lexicographically smaller category.

Return the result table ordered by season in **ascending** order.

## Solution (MySQL, annotated)

```sql
# Group by the pairs (season, category) sales
WITH season_sales AS(
    SELECT
        (
            CASE
                WHEN (MONTH(s.sale_date) >= 3 AND MONTH(s.sale_date) < 6) THEN "Spring"
                WHEN (MONTH(s.sale_date) >= 6 AND MONTH(s.sale_date) < 9) THEN "Summer"
                WHEN (MONTH(s.sale_date) >= 9 AND MONTH(s.sale_date) < 12) THEN "Fall"
            ELSE "Winter" END
        ) AS season,
        p.category,
        SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity,
        SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS total_revenue
    FROM sales s
    JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY (
            CASE
                WHEN (MONTH(s.sale_date) >= 3 AND MONTH(s.sale_date) < 6) THEN "Spring"
                WHEN (MONTH(s.sale_date) >= 6 AND MONTH(s.sale_date) < 9) THEN "Summer"
                WHEN (MONTH(s.sale_date) >= 9 AND MONTH(s.sale_date) < 12) THEN "Fall"
            ELSE "Winter" END
    ), p.category
),

# Classify the ranks of most popular categories
# quantity → revenue → lexicography
ranked AS (
    SELECT
        season,
        category,
        total_quantity,
        total_revenue,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY season
            ORDER BY
                total_quantity DESC,
                total_revenue DESC,
                category ASC
        ) AS rn
    FROM season_sales
)

# Filter out the popular categories
SELECT
    season,
    category,
    total_quantity,
    total_revenue
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```

> DuckDB note: MySQL treats `"..."` as string literals by default, but
> DuckDB parses them as identifiers — `solution.sql` switches them to
> single quotes (`'Spring'`). MySQL `#` comments also fail in DuckDB and
> become `--` comments. Finally, the statement requires the output ordered
> by season ascending, so `solution.sql` appends `ORDER BY season ASC` to
> the final SELECT.
